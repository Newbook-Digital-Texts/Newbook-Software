ToDo List:
  * asterisk with wrong unicode? -- example on page 66
  * last few pages not printing
  * incrementing div1s "n" attribute
  * line issue with double spaces print or not
  * Maybe include percentages of each type of error in the error messages
  * Initial, Middle, Final
  * TEI header included into the autotagger code
  * add first div2
  * Linecount should start at 1 not 0
  * page 371 empty p node?
  * make a create_div1 method to clean up code, like the create_div2 method
  * if there are more div2s left than there are *s, then print 
    a warning message that the file may have too many or too few stars (maybe do the same for div1s)

Fixed:
  * catching Line #: in body that isn't an error

Desiderata for future iterations:
  * provide configuration model for autotagger:
    ** first option here is 'multilinugal=yes/no'
