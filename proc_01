        <head>Rendering TEI Documents for Traditional Consumption</head>
        <div2>
          <head>Simplfying Structure</head>
          <p>Humanities documents that are marked up with TEI can
          contain explicit information about many features of texts
          in many domains.  Much of this analytical structure is not
          immediately relevant in the context of rendering the text
          for a reader.   Consider a TEI text with annotations indicating
          the grammatical part of speech of each word.  These annotations,
          while relevant in the context of a linguistic discussion of the
          text, would be distracting to a general reader who wants to 
          interact with the narrative, unconcerned with syntax.</p>

          <p>There are other aspects of TEI structure which are relevant
          for printing even in the general context, but which we currently
          set aside in the interest of producing a working product this 
          summer.  For example, some TEI texts contain rich indexical  
          information about cannonical names of entities.  This sort of
          information can be leveraged to create an appendicies for a
          printed text which allow a reader to look up the page numbers
          where certain words or topics are discussed.</p>

          <p>Finally, printed media bring their own set of constraints
          on what can be represented.  For example, traditional typesetting
          in Latin based alphabets provides alternative glyph shapes 
          (for example, <emph rend="italics">italics</emph>) which
          an author can use to indicate distinctions in the text.  But
          there are only a only a small number of alternative 
          glyph shapes<ref target="#n0" /> and we can imagine a TEI
          document which encodes a large set of distinct information
          types.  While the particular constraints of a rendered medium
          differ from instance to instance (consider HTML in a browser
          vs ink on a page), the point here is that all cases require
          a simplification of the structures available in TEI.</p>

          <p>To sum up, printing a TEI document for a general reader
          requires a simplification of structure.  The complete TEI
          provides more information than can be squeezed onto a page
          designed to emphasize the orginal narrative.  For these reasons, 
          the electronic publication group within NDTH has selected a  
          subset of TEI structures to support in our work for summer 2013.
          The rest of this document illustrates those structures and
          presents the formatting associated with each structure.</p>
          <note xml:id="n0">Some Latin-based fonts include monospace, italic, 
          bold, small caps, perhaps a few other variants.  However, a 
          document which used very many of these alternatives to represent 
          up meta-textual features runs the risk of distracting the general 
          reader from the content of the narrative.</note>

        <head>The Structures</head>
        <div2>
          <p>The content of TEI documents is contained in an &lt;text&gt;
          element.  This element can contain &lt;front&gt; and &lt;back&gt;
          elements, alongside a required &lt;body&gt;.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2>
          <head>&lt;front&gt;</head>
          <p>Within the &lt;front&gt; element, the printing methods we are
          developing will look for title page information within the 
          &lt;titlePage&gt; element (if present).  For the moment, we
          support &lt;titlePart&gt; and &lt;byline&gt; within 
          &lt;titlePage&gt;.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2>
          <head>&lt;body&gt;</head>
          <p>Within the &lt;body&gt; our methods will support two 
           levels of text structure<ref target="#n1"/>.  These are
           &lt;div1&gt; and &lt;div2&gt;.  in the case of diaries the
           &lt;div1&gt; will probably represent collections of 
           diary entries ('chapters', or 'journies' or 
           'months' for example<ref target="#n2" />).  &lt;div2&gt; will be individual
           diary entries.</p>
          <p>&lt;pb n="1" /&gt; is the page break element, which is a milestone marker to 
          	show page divisions within a document. The "n" attribute identifies the page 
          	numbers of the original document.</p>
          <p>&lt;lb n="1" /&gt; is the line break element, which is a milestone marker to 
          	show line divisions within a prose document. The "n" attribute identifies the line 
          	numbers of the original document. Line breaks and line break numbers will not 
            be represented in the output. Prose text will be presented as flowing paragraphs.</p>
          <p>&lt;lg&gt; is used to indicate verse groups such as stanzas.</p>
          <p>&lt;l&gt; is used to indicate individual lines of verse. These lines will be retained
            in output. </p>
          <p>Drawings in the original documents should be indicated using the following elements.
            &lt;figure&gt;&lt;head&gt; An old temple &lt;/head&gt;&lt;graphic url="temple.jpg"/&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt; The drawing, a caption, and the file name of the image are identified 
            by the figure, head, and graphic elements. In the output, only the image file name will 
            be displayed.</p>
            <p> Lists may include passagers, cargo, relatives, etc.: 
               &lt;list&gt;
                  &lt;item&gt;Antone Marine&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;
                  &lt;item&gt;Eliza, my wife&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;
            </p>
             <p> Documents may contain tables, such as train schedules:
             	&lt;table&gt;
             		&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Arrive&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Depart&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;
             	&lt;/table&gt;</p>
            <p>Commonly used content elements include &lt;name&gt;Alexander Svoboda &lt;/name&gt; and 
               &lt;foreign&gt;פָּעְָלוֹ&lt;/foreign&gt; words and phrases. Our practice is to use &lt;foreign&gt;
               to represent scripts and languages other than the source text.</p>
          <note xml:id="n1">Note here about multilingual config: div1 (container)
          then: div2,div3.</note>
          <note xml:id="n2">Note that texts can still use the @type attribute to
          further specify types of &lt;div1&gt;,&lt;div2&gt;,&lt;head&gt;,
          etc.  It's just that for now the automatic printing processes
          aren't going to do anything about that info if it's present.</note>
